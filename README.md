## Welcome to Mys-AI Lab

### MYS-AI lab is a boutique AI and machine learning lab in Nagoya-Japan. 
### We're aiming to be the most fun and innovative AI lab to help solve humanityâ€™s problems..  

We're architecturing algorithms for machine to transform data into knowledge. We bring together technologies in computational, cognitive, and behavioral sciences to better understand future human development processes.

### Research 
At Mysolutions lab, our research focuses are:
- information transmission by spoken languages,
- dynamics of the collective intelligence lifecycle,

and some of the research topics we are excited about:
- natural language processing and acoustic modelling, 
- computer speech and logic,
- human-computer interaction,
- human-computer learning,
- communications, 
- art,
- complex system behaviour.

### Teaching
We'd love to share our knowledge  and findings with our fellow citizens of the earth. At Mysolutions lab we will welcome all learning enthusiasts to do learn-by-doing in:
- machine learning, deep learning , neural networking architecture,
- quantum computing programming
- programming,
- communication and knowledge expansion.  

## Some of our projects
We design and develop **human-machine spoken language systems**.

  ### Downloadable stand-alone packages
   - Speaking Guess-Game: Pictures-Phrases (https://github.com/Shahabks/My-Pictures-Phrases-Guess-Game/releases)
    - A Machine Learning Algorithm to predict your spoken language proficiency level
