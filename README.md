## Welcome to Sab-AI Lab

### Sab-AI lab is a boutique AI and machine learning lab in Nagoya-Japan. 
### We're aiming to be the most fun and innovative AI lab 
### We dedicate our resources to the study and simulation of memories, thinking process, behavior - the goal is to build effective and efficient neural networks and AI algorithms .  

We're architecturing algorithms for machine to transform data into knowledge. We bring together technologies in computational, cognitive, and behavioral sciences to better understand future human development processes.

### Research 
At Mysolutions lab, our research focuses are:
- information transmission by spoken languages,
- dynamics of the collective intelligence lifecycle,

and some of the research topics we are excited about:
- natural language processing and acoustic modelling, 
- computer speech and logic,
- human-computer interaction,
- human-computer learning,
- communications, 
- art,
- complex system behaviour
