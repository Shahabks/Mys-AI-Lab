## Welcome to Mysolutions Lab

### MYSOLUTIONS lab is a boutique AI and machine learning lab in Nagoya-Japan. 
### We're aiming to be the most fun and innovative AI lab to help solve humanity’s problems..  

We're architecturing algorithms for machine to transform data into knowledge. We bring together technologies in computational, cognitive, and behavioral sciences to better understand future human development processes.

### Research 
At Mysolutions lab, our research focuses are:
- information transmission by spoken languages,
- dynamics of the collective intelligence lifecycle,

and some of the research topics we are excited about:
- natural language processing and acoustic modelling, 
- computer speech and logic,
- human-computer interaction,
- human-computer learning,
- communications, 
- art,
- complex system behaviour.

### Teaching
We'd love to share our knowledge  and findings with our fellow citizens of the earth. At Mysolutions lab we will welcome all learning enthusiasts to do learn-by-doing in:
- machine learning, deep learning , neural networking architecture,
- quantum computing programming
- programming,
- communication and knowledge expansion.  

## Some of our projects
We design and develop **human-machine spoken language systems**.

  ### Downloadable stand-alone packages
